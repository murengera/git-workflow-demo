# Git Workflow Demo

A comprehensive demonstration of modern Git workflows and best practices for collaborative development.

## Overview

This repository serves as a practical example of implementing effective Git workflows in software development projects. It demonstrates various branching strategies, commit conventions, and collaboration patterns that teams can adopt to improve their development process.

## Features

- **Branching Strategy**: Demonstrates feature branch workflow with main/master branch protection
- **Commit Conventions**: Examples of conventional commit messages and semantic versioning
- **Pull Request Templates**: Standardized templates for code reviews
- **CI/CD Integration**: Examples of automated testing and deployment workflows
- **Collaboration Guidelines**: Best practices for team development

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git installed on your system
- Basic understanding of Git commands
- Access to a Git hosting platform (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/git-workflow-demo.git
   cd git-workflow-demo
   ```

2. Review the workflow examples and documentation

3. Follow the branching and commit conventions demonstrated

## Workflow Examples

### Feature Development

```bash
# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make your changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature functionality"

# Push and create pull request
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

### Bug Fixes

```bash
# Create a hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug

# Fix the issue and commit
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve critical bug in user authentication"

# Push and create pull request
git push origin hotfix/critical-bug
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Commit Message Convention

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

## Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/` - New features
- `bugfix/` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/` - Critical fixes for production
- `release/` - Release preparation
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
