## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git installed on your system (version 2.20+ recommended)
- Basic understanding of Git commands
- Access to a Git hosting platform (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- Code editor or IDE with Git integration
- Terminal or command line interface

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/git-workflow-demo.git
   cd git-workflow-demo
   ```

2. Review the workflow examples and documentation

3. Follow the branching and commit conventions demonstrated

4. Set up your Git configuration:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   git config --global init.defaultBranch main
   ```

## Workflow Examples

### Feature Development

```bash
# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make your changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature functionality"

# Push and create pull request
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

### Bug Fixes

```bash
# Create a hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug

# Fix the issue and commit
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve critical bug in user authentication"

# Push and create pull request
git push origin hotfix/critical-bug
```

### Release Preparation

```bash
# Create a release branch
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0

# Update version numbers and changelog
git add .
git commit -m "chore: prepare release v1.2.0"

# Merge to main and tag
git checkout main
git merge release/v1.2.0
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release version 1.2.0"
git push origin main --tags

# Clean up release branch
git branch -d release/v1.2.0
git push origin --delete release/v1.2.0
```

## Advanced Git Concepts

### Interactive Rebase

```bash
# Rebase the last 3 commits interactively
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# During rebase, you can:
# - pick: keep commit as is
# - reword: change commit message
# - edit: modify commit content
# - squash: combine with previous commit
# - fixup: combine but discard message
```

### Cherry-picking

```bash
# Apply a specific commit to current branch
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# Cherry-pick multiple commits
git cherry-pick <commit1> <commit2> <commit3>
```

### Stashing

```bash
# Save current work temporarily
git stash push -m "WIP: feature in progress"

# List all stashes
git stash list

# Apply specific stash
git stash apply stash@{1}

# Pop and remove stash
git stash pop
```

## Team Collaboration

### Code Review Process

1. **Pull Request Creation**
   - Use descriptive titles
   - Include detailed descriptions
   - Reference related issues
   - Add appropriate labels

2. **Review Checklist**
   - [ ] Code follows style guidelines
   - [ ] Tests are included and passing
   - [ ] Documentation is updated
   - [ ] No debugging code remains
   - [ ] Performance considerations addressed

3. **Review Comments**
   - Be constructive and specific
   - Suggest alternatives when possible
   - Use @mentions for specific team members
   - Resolve conversations when addressed

### Pair Programming with Git

```bash
# Share your branch with a colleague
git push origin feature/collaborative-feature

# Colleague can then:
git fetch origin
git checkout -b feature/collaborative-feature origin/feature/collaborative-feature

# After collaboration, both can pull updates
git pull origin feature/collaborative-feature
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Merge Conflicts

```bash
# Check for conflicts
git status

# Resolve conflicts in your editor
# Then mark as resolved
git add <resolved-files>

# Complete the merge
git commit -m "Merge branch 'feature/conflict-resolution'"
```

### Undoing Changes

```bash
# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (discard changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Undo uncommitted changes
git checkout -- <file>

# Revert a specific commit
git revert <commit-hash>
```

### Recovering Lost Commits

```bash
# Find lost commits
git reflog

# Recover specific commit
git checkout -b recovery-branch <commit-hash>

# Or reset to specific commit
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```

## Git Hooks and Automation

### Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run tests
npm test

# Check commit message format
npx commitlint --edit $1
```

### Post-merge Hooks

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/post-merge

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run database migrations
npm run migrate

# Clear caches
npm run cache:clear
```

## Performance Optimization

### Git Configuration

```bash
# Enable Git LFS for large files
git lfs install

# Configure Git for better performance
git config --global core.preloadindex true
git config --global core.fsmonitor true
git config --global gc.auto 256

# Use shallow clones for large repositories
git clone --depth 1 <repository-url>
```

### Repository Maintenance

```bash
# Clean up old branches
git remote prune origin
git branch --merged | grep -v "\*" | xargs -n 1 git branch -d

# Optimize repository
git gc --aggressive --prune=now
git repack -a -d --depth=250 --window=250
```

## Security Best Practices

### Branch Protection Rules

- Require pull request reviews
- Dismiss stale reviews on new commits
- Require status checks to pass
- Restrict pushes to protected branches
- Require signed commits

### Commit Signing

```bash
# Generate GPG key
gpg --full-generate-key

# Configure Git to use GPG
git config --global user.signingkey <your-gpg-key-id>
git config --global commit.gpgsign true

# Sign commits
git commit -S -m "feat: signed commit message"
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Contribution Guidelines

- Follow the established coding standards
- Write clear commit messages
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Respond to review feedback promptly

## Commit Message Convention

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks
- `perf:` Performance improvements
- `ci:` CI/CD configuration changes
- `build:` Build system changes
- `revert:` Revert previous commits

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Examples:
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 authentication support

fix(api): resolve timeout issue in user endpoint

docs(readme): update installation instructions

BREAKING CHANGE: API response format has changed
```

## Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/` - New features
- `bugfix/` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/` - Critical fixes for production
- `release/` - Release preparation
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test-related changes
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

### Branch Structure

```
main (or master)
├── develop
│   ├── feature/user-authentication
│   ├── feature/payment-integration
│   └── bugfix/login-validation
├── release/v1.2.0
└── hotfix/security-patch
```

## Release Management

### Semantic Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR**: New functionality in backward-compatible manner
- **PATCH**: Backward-compatible bug fixes

### Release Process

1. **Planning**: Identify features and fixes for release
2. **Development**: Implement changes in feature branches
3. **Integration**: Merge to develop branch
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing on develop branch
5. **Release Branch**: Create release branch from develop
6. **Final Testing**: Final testing and bug fixes
7. **Release**: Merge to main and tag
8. **Hotfixes**: Apply critical fixes directly to main

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Run linting
        run: npm run lint

  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: echo "Deploying to production..."
```
